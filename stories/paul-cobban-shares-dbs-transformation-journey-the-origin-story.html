            </div>

            <p>&ldquo;The first day on the job, I got into a taxi and told the driver to take me to DBS. He turned
              around, &ldquo;DBS? Damn Bloody Slow.&rdquo; Of course, this was 12 &frac12; years ago, in 2010, when
              snaking queues at our ATMs and branches defined us. It also happened to be exactly what I - the
              transformation guy - was hired to tackle.&nbsp;</p>


            <div class="articleImage">
              <img src="../images/articles/article001-02.jpg" alt="">
            </div>

            <p>Paul Cobban has over a decade of experience driving transformation programmes and change
              at DBS as the former Chief Data and Transformation Officer.</p>

            <h3>2010, the pivotal year</h3>

            <p>Dave Gledhill, the Chief Information Officer at that time, and I, started running Process Improvement
              Events (PIE). We would run five-day workshops - essentially bringing people from various departments into
              a room to walk us through their processes. Areas for improvement would be identified and quickly
              implemented the week after.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class="articleImage">
              <img src="../images/articles/article001-03.jpg" alt="">
              <p class="caption"><em>The first PIE</em></p>
            </div>

            <p>There were definitely funny stories that emerged when we were walking through processes.
              I phoned Kelvin, the first guy I brought into the improvement team - now known as the transformation group
              - who was being walked through the credit card application process.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I said, &ldquo;So how&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going really
              well, but you&rsquo;re not going to believe this. There&rsquo;s a step in the process where there&rsquo;s
              cutting and pasting, and I don&rsquo;t mean control-c/control-v, I mean scissors and glue,
              literally.&rdquo; We saw all these amazing old processes that nobody had reviewed for the longest
              time.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Back then, we defined success for these PIE events by how many customer waiting hours we
              could cut. I estimated that we could cut 10 million hours - and was completely off the mark.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>In just that first year, we cut 250 million customer waiting hours. If you go back that
              amount of time, you&rsquo;d end up in the stone age!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This newfound time on our customers&rsquo; hands? They could feel it. That year, 2010,
              DBS skyrocketed from the bottom to the top of customer satisfaction scores.</p>

            <p>On the employee front, a newfound energy was also unlocked. In hindsight, and
              corroborated by Dave and Piyush, 2010 was a pivotal year for us in DBS&rsquo; history, and a foundation
              for things to come.</p>

            <div class="articleImage">
              <img src="../images/articles/article001-04.jpg" alt="">
              <p class="caption"><em>DBS in the news in 2013</em></p>
            </div>

            <h3>The beginning of the RED programme</h3>

            <p>Exactly at the same time, Piyush&rsquo;s first ask was to &ldquo;define Asian service&rdquo;. It was one
              of the five pillars identified in the strategy to become Asian bank of choice. He said, &ldquo;Can you
              please go and define what it means?&rdquo; I was trying to impress him, I said, &ldquo;Give me a couple of
              weeks&rdquo;, and he said, &ldquo;No, take six months.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>During that time, my team and I spoke to customers, employees and experts, and came up with 96 different
              definitions of Asian service. After which, we spent two days with the top 50 in the company, and came up
              with the concept of RED; &ldquo;Respectful&rdquo;, &ldquo;Easy to deal with&rdquo;, and
              &ldquo;Dependable&rdquo;. It would take us another six to nine months to design how this would fit in with
              the PIEs - how its training and various components would be spelt out.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>In 2011, at the first leadership conference under Piyush&rsquo;s tenure, we launched RED formally and
              implemented it across the company. The PIEs would now fall under RED.</p>

            <p>And just like that, our employees&rsquo; newfound energy to better serve customers became a unified
              front.</p>

            <h3>From PIE to customer journeys</h3>

            <p>Back then, returning lost credit cards to customers would take five days - which also meant lost revenue
              for five days. So as per usual, we ran a successful PIE and got the time down to a day.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>But for the first time, we actually went a step further, and called a customer who had been through the
              process. We said, &ldquo;Madam, how did you like getting your credit card in a day?&rdquo; She said,
              &ldquo;Wonderful, thank you very much, but where&rsquo;s my debit card? I lost my handbag in a shopping
              mall.&rdquo; A huge light bulb went on for us!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>We had been tackling this issue from a DBS perspective, but customers had completely different
              challenges. I was so lucky at that time, we had a new guy join the team who had a background in human
              centred design - and this was before that concept was actually a thing.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks to him, we found ourselves in shopping malls, speaking to people. We came up with three problems
              people in Singapore who lost their bags would face back then.&nbsp;</p>

            <ol>
              <li><p>How am I going to go home? I&rsquo;ve got no cash. (Mind you, this was during the pre-digital era)
              </p></li>
              <li><p>I worry that somebody is using my credit card now fraudulently&nbsp;</p></li>
              <li><p>I have to re-link my new credit card to different aspects of my life&nbsp;</p></li>
            </ol>

            <p>Based on those, we made changes to our call centre script. If somebody phones in a lost credit card, the
              call centre agent would empathise and ask if they&rsquo;re okay. Previously we went straight to the
              authentication questions, which implied that our customer was a criminal unless proven otherwise!&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>The agent would then walk them through the process and explain what&rsquo;s going to happen. The call
              would end with &ldquo;Would you like us to send you some useful phone numbers to get your life back on
              track?&rdquo;</p>

            <p>It was a huge hit - customer satisfaction scores went through the roof. We pivoted from PIEs to customer
              journeys, and opened another chapter in our history book.</p>

            <p>Piyush describes my team as a secret weapon because we create bandwidth to do some of the transformation.
              But I would say that the true secret weapon is DBS&rsquo; open culture. When I had brought my same crazy
              ideas to my previous employer, there&rsquo;d be 20 people around me explaining why it&rsquo;s a bad idea
              and would never work.&nbsp;</p>
